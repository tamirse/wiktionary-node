> Look up words on [wiktionary.org](https://www.wiktionary.org/) in English, and return a well-structed json. (Other languages will be supported later)

Welcome to star this [project](https://github.com/laphets/wiktionary-node) on GitHub.

## Install

```
npm i wiktionary-node
```

## Usage in Node

You can call wiktionary("someword", "searchLanguage") with an argument with some word, the requested search language, and it will return a promise.

Note: This will search the english wiktionary, and the result will be the result of the "searchLanguage" argument.

Note 2: It appears it returns only one etymology

### Traditional Promise

```js
const wiktionary = require("wiktionary-node");

wiktionary("word", "Spanish")
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch(error => {});
```

### Async Function

```js
const wiktionary = require("wiktionary-node");

const main = async (word, searchLangauge) => {
  try {
    const define = await wiktionary(word, searchLangauge);
  } catch (error) {}
};
```

## Result

The result is like this

```json
